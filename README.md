I'm a former Speech and Drama teacher now turn full stack software developer after a career pivot, looking for my next opportunity. I recently graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa, where I learnt to build fullstack software applications in a simulated Agile work environment.

Problem solving has always been at the heart of everything I do. Earlier this year I decided to take the plunge into coding after many years of interest in tech.

I’m now hugely passionate about building fullstack applications, collaborating with other developers, learning new programming languages and frameworks, and sharing my knowledge. I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and can’t wait to contribute value to a development team!

For my final group project at Dev Academy! I had a blast collaborating with my team, and embraced the struggle of stretching my knowledge even further with Auth0, Multer, and many-to-many relational databases.
