I'm a former Speech and Drama teacher now turn full stack software developer after a career pivot, looking for my next opportunity. I recently graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa, where I learnt to build fullstack software applications in a simulated Agile work environment.

Problem solving has always been at the heart of everything I do. Earlier this year I decided to take the plunge into coding after many years of interest in tech.

Iâ€™m now hugely passionate about building fullstack applications, collaborating with other developers, learning new programming languages and frameworks, and sharing my knowledge. I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and canâ€™t wait to contribute value to a development team!
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

I have a few different projects in the mix, which I'll be looking to build in some tech I haven't used yet. Watch this space!

For my final group project at Dev Academy! I had a blast collaborating with my team, and embraced the struggle of stretching my knowledge even further with Auth0, Multer, and many-to-many relational databases.
