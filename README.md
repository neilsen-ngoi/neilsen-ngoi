I'm a former Speech and Drama teacher now turned full stack software developer after a career pivot, looking for my next opportunity. I recently graduated from Dev Academy Aotearoa, where I learnt to build fullstack software applications in a simulated Agile work environment.



















Problem solving has always been at the heart of everything I do. Earlier this year I decided to take the plunge into coding after many years of interest in tech.

Iâ€™m now hugely passionate about building fullstack applications, collaborating with other developers, learning new programming languages and frameworks, and sharing my knowledge. I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and canâ€™t wait to contribute value to a development team!

For my final group project at Dev Academy! I had a blast collaborating with my team, and embraced the struggle of stretching my knowledge even further with Auth0, Multer, and many-to-many relational databases.

In my spare time you`ll find me tearing apart and putting stuff back together (inanimate things), getting lost somewhere, or wandering the new places. 

**Open to work or collaboration!**  
Im currently looking for a developer position or developer adjacent in Auckland or beyond.
